# C89 vs C17 Network Server and Client

## I made this project to compare the differences between idiomatic C89 and C17 code
## Implements client and server in two languages

### To run c89
```bash
# Build
make

# Run server
./bin/server

# In another terminal, run client
./bin/client
```


### To run C17
```bash
# Build
make clean
make

# Run server (Terminal 1)
./bin/server

# Run client (Terminal 2)
./bin/client
```
